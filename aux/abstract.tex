	In the fifties, Adams introduced a comparison map from his cobar construction on the (simplicial) singular chains of a pointed space to the cubical singular chains on its based loop space.
	This comparison map is a quasi-isomorphism of algebras, which was shown by Baues to be one of bialgebras by considering Serre's cubical coproduct.
	In this work we generalize Baues result proving that Adams' comparison map is a quasi-isomorphism of $E_{\infty}$-bialgebras, i.e. of monoids in the category of $E_{\infty}$-coalgebras.
	We also show that Hess--Tonks' extended cobar construction on the chains of a general reduced simplicial set is quasi-isomorphic as an $E_{\infty}$-coalgebra to the chains on the associated Kan loop group.
