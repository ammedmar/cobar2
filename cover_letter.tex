	\maketitle
	The present paper continues a line of investigation pioneered by F. Adams and H.-J. Baues.
	It studies algebraic models of based loop spaces in the category of $E_\infty$-coalgebras.
	The main results established here enhance conceptually and explicitly the clarity of the structures present on the cobar construction and the Adams map.

	We believe this work can be thoroughly and impartially evaluated by any of the following well established mathematicians, all of which have made significant contributions to this line of research.
	In alphabetical order they are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Clemens Berger,
		\item Matthias Franz,
		\item Benoit Fresse,
		\item Kathryn Hess,
		\item Paul-Eug√®ne Parent,
		\item Mahmoud Zeinalian.
	\end{itemize}
